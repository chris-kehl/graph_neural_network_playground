This is a repository for playing around with graph neural networks.
I am learning graph neural netorks from Zak Jost, he offers a small 
program to get started with tutorials and videos. 

As this repository progresses I'll add more, for now i'm just learning.

All code is based off of this link:

The first pthon notebook dgl_Graph_neural_networks.ipynb is the mnist version of graph neural networks. This classifies Cora
citation network into 7 classes, we predict the category of a node.  The paper reference can be found at the following url
